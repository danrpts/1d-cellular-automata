# Elementary cellular automata

## What is a cellular automaton?
A cellular automaton (CA) is an artificial lifeform. As compelling as this sounds, this lifeform is still a machine with simple construction. Informally, an automaton is a set of finite state machines called cells. These cells communicate with one another to iteratively produce a new generation of cells. Despite their simplicity, over time these cell generations can exhibit complex behavior in the realm of chaos, order, and somehwere inbetween. This is precisely why they are of special interest.


## What about Turing completeness?
Some cellular automata are Turing complete e.g. the elementary CA Rule 110. This means all Turing machines can be simulated (all real-world computational problems) can be solved using cellular automata.
