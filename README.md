## What is a cellular automaton?
A cellular automaton (CA) is an artificial lifeform. As compelling as this sounds, a CA is still a machine following simple rules. Informally, a CA is a set of finite state machines called cells. These cells communicate with one another to produce a new generation of cells with respect to time. Despite its simplicity, a CA can still exhibit behavior in the realm of chaos, order, and somehwere inbetween. The resulting complexity is precisely why they are of special interest.

## What about Turing completeness?
Some cellular automata are Turing complete e.g. the elementary rule 110. This means all Turing machines can be simulated (all real-world computational problems can be solved) using cellular automata.
