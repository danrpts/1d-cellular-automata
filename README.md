# Elementary cellular automata

## What is a cellular automaton?
A cellular automaton is an artificial lifeform. This sounds compelling, however, examination reveals the lifeform as just information being processed over time. It is so simple that it becomes easy to overlook in triviality. But, is this lifeform not similar to what we are? In essence, are we not a chunk of three dimensional information propgating through time?
