# Elementary cellular automata

## What is a cellular automaton?
A cellular automaton (CA) is an artificial lifeform. As compelling as this sounds, this lifeform is still a machine with simple construction. Informally, an automaton is a set of finite state machines called cells. These cells communicate with one another to iteratively produce a new generation of cells. Despite their simplicity, over time these cell generations can exhibit complex behavior in the realm of chaos, order, and somehwere inbetween. This is precisely why they are of special interest.


## Turing completeness
Some cellular automata are Turing complete e.g. the elementary CA Rule 110. This means that any Turing machine can be simulated, or in other words, any real-world computational problem can be solved using the specific cellular automata.
